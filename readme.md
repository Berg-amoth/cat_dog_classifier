# Cat & Dog classifier

## Introduction
This project is a simple cat & dog classifier. It uses the [Keras](https://keras.io/) deep learning library to build a convolutional neural network. The network is trained with a sample of the Cats-vs-Dogs dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shaunthesheep/microsoft-catsvsdogs-dataset).
